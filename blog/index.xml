      <description>This week I am attending my very first VMworld Europe in, of all places, beautiful, Barcelona, Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ll write a synopsis of VMworld after it&amp;rsquo;s over, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to my blogging series after VMworld is over. For this post, I want to cover my first very International VMUG event. Continue reading for my viewpoint of the event.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out about the VMUG until the very last minute.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this series, I wrote about why I chose to use Hugo to develop this blog and GitHub Pages to host it. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through the steps to create a Hugo site, apply a theme, and create a very simple blog post. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get going!
Before You Get Started Before you get started, you need to gather a few bits and bytes.</description>

      <description>If you read my very first post, you would know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about writing a blog for years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for years for employers. But, just recently, I finally launched my first technical blog. The one you are reading right now. I also have a travel blog that only gets updated when I travel for vacation. In this blog series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how I built my blog site using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.
A bit about me I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire. My wife and I have lived in New England for many years. We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.</description>
