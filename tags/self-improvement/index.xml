      <description>Most people post their New Years&amp;rsquo; blog posts within the first week of the new year. But, there have been some things brewing that I needed to wait to complete. This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t like my other posts. It&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at what transpired in 2020 and what I hope to accomplish this year. I also have an announcement about some exciting new changes that have been brewing since late last year.</description>

      <description>This post is one of those times where I put tech aside. So, if you are only interested in tech-related blog posts, then you may want to skip this one. If I caught your interest (W00t!!), then please continue.
&amp;ldquo;MacGyvering&amp;rdquo; My Career Path My career path didn&amp;rsquo;t follow a traditional plan or approach. But, then again, does that really happen to anyone? If you can say yes, then good for you.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.
A bit about me I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire. My wife and I have lived in New England for many years. We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.</description>
