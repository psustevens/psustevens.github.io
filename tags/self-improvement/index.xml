      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for a new job.  But due to an unforeseen curveball, I now work for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purestorage.com/&#34;&gt;Pure Storage&lt;/a&gt;.  This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a planned move, but looking back (6 months now).  I have no complaints!!  I wish all of my friends and colleagues at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.entrust.com/&#34;&gt;Entrust&lt;/a&gt; the best of luck and I know we will see each other at future trade shows or somewhere else along our travels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people post their New Years&amp;rsquo; blog posts within the first week of the new year.  But, there have been some things brewing that I needed to wait to complete.  This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t like my other posts.  It&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at what transpired in 2020 and what I hope to accomplish this year. I also have an announcement about some exciting new changes that have been brewing since late last year.  Before I forget, Happy New Year!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is one of those times where I put tech aside.  So, if you are only interested in tech-related blog posts, then you may want to skip this one.  If I caught your interest (W00t!!), then please continue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;macgyvering-my-career-path&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;MacGyvering&amp;rdquo; My Career Path&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My career path didn&amp;rsquo;t follow a traditional plan or approach.  But, then again, does that really happen to anyone?  If you can say yes, then good for you.  When I was growing up, I always wanted to be a garbage man.  Yes, I know that isn&amp;rsquo;t politically correct today, but this is my blog.  At one point, I also considered being a fireman.  I think, as a little boy, many of us had these grandiose plans.  Oh, to be seven years old again!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing... Me</title>
      <link>https://blog.psustevens.com/2019/09/30/introducing-me/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-bit-about-me&#34;&gt;A bit about me&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire.  My wife and I have lived in New England for many years.  We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.   I supported the EqualLogic and Compellent SAN products and their NAS front-end for both of those systems by the name of Fluid File System.  After a few years, I moved to a startup by the  name of DataGravity where I was also a technical marketing engineer.  After a few years at DataGravity, HyTrust came along and scooped us up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
