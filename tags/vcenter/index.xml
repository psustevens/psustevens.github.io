      <description>I recently wrote about a little issue where I had to quickly get my lab hosts and vCenter upgraded to vSphere 7.0U3k luckily vSphere Lifecycle Manager saved me. During that process I discovered in vCenter there are a bunch of API calls you can make directly from the CLI once you SSH into vCenter.</description>

      <description>Recently, I ran into an issue where I really needed to get my vSphere homelab upgraded to version 7.0U3k. More on why this was so urgent in a future post. However, I was still back on 7.0U3d. To get to 7.0U3 I used vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM). In case you missed it, vSphere Lifecycle Manager is built into vSphere 7.</description>

      <description>Around this time last year I wrote about how to deploy a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. That post covered KeyControl version 5.2.1. You can find that blog post over here.&#xA;This post is very similar. The difference between it and the last post is that I will cover Entrust KeyControl version 5.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my How to Deploy a HyTrust KeyControl 2-node Cluster post I walked through the steps for deploying and configuring a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. Now that you have it deployed, let&amp;rsquo;s start using it. But before we can do that, we need to add it vCenter as a Key Provider.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will write about using the file-based backup feature in vCenter v7.0. Surprisingly, this feature has been available since vCenter 6.5. But, until recently, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard much about it.&#xA;Before getting started, you should read through the list of considerations and limitations of using file-based backups for vCenter.</description>
