I also walked through the process to create the first blog post for your new site. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through different customization options for the theme. The customizations aren&amp;rsquo;t exhaustive but are good enough for you to get started and possibly expand on.</description>

      <description>If you read my very first post, you would know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about writing a blog for years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for years for employers.
