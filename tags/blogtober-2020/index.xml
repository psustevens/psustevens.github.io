      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hit my first anniversary of blogging this past September.  As you may have noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit lax over the main course of this year.  I know, I know.  With the whole COVID thing going on this year, you would have thought there would have been more time to blog.  After sheltering in place and being forced to work from home, I got busier.  At the height of the pandemic, I was on six or more conference calls a  day.  It was exhausting.  I think that folks (including me) were being drained, both mentally and physically, from being on so many calls.  Eventually, things calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
