      <description>In the previous post, I covered how to build your first Hugo site using the Hugo Future Imperfect Slim theme. I also walked through the process to create the first blog post for your new site. In this post, I&#39;m going to walk through different customization options for the theme. The customizations aren&#39;t exhaustive but are good enough for you to get started and possibly expand on. Let&#39;s get started.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this series, I wrote about why I chose to use Hugo to develop this blog and GitHub Pages to host it. In this post, I&#39;m going to walk through the steps to create a Hugo site, apply a theme, and create a very simple blog post. So, let&#39;s get going!
 Before You Get Started Before you get started, you need to gather a few bits and bytes.</description>

      <description>If you read my very first post, you would know that I&#39;ve been thinking about writing a blog for years. I&#39;ve been blogging for years for employers. But, just recently, I finally launched my first technical blog. The one you are reading right now. I also have a travel blog that only gets updated when I travel for vacation. In this blog series, I&#39;m going to talk about how I built my blog site using Hugo.</description>
