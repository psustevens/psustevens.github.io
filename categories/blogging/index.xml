      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I last updated this series.  I apologize to anyone who is following it and lost interest.  I hope to be quicker in future series I write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will walk through what I do to publish my blog to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/psustevens/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.  I use private and public repositories and &lt;a href=&#34;https://desktop.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.  This way, I can do some testing in my private repo before pushing it to my public repo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hit my first anniversary of blogging this past September.  As you may have noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit lax over the main course of this year.  I know, I know.  With the whole COVID thing going on this year, you would have thought there would have been more time to blog.  After sheltering in place and being forced to work from home, I got busier.  At the height of the pandemic, I was on six or more conference calls a  day.  It was exhausting.  I think that folks (including me) were being drained, both mentally and physically, from being on so many calls.  Eventually, things calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I covered how to customize the theme for your Hugo site.  I apologize if it was a bit long.  This post is considerably shorter.  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through how to configure &lt;a href=&#34;https://analytics.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; for your site.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-we-get-started&#34;&gt;Before we get started&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are already familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://analytics.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, then this will be a short read for you.  All you need to do is:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I covered how to build your first Hugo site using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/&#34;&gt;Hugo Future Imperfect Slim theme&lt;/a&gt;.  I also walked through the process to create the first blog post for your new site.  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through different customization options for the theme.  The customizations aren&amp;rsquo;t exhaustive but are good enough for you to get started and possibly expand on.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.psustevens.com/2019/10/11/building-a-blog-with-hugo/&#34;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I wrote about why I chose to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to develop this blog and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; to host it.  In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through the steps to create a Hugo site, apply a theme, and create a very simple blog post.  So, let&amp;rsquo;s get going!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for years for employers.  But, just recently, I finally launched my first technical blog.  The one you are reading right now.  I also have a travel blog that only gets updated when I travel for vacation.  In this blog series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how I built my blog site using Hugo.  This post is part one of a five-part series.  Why Hugo?  Keep reading to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
