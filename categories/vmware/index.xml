      <description>I recently wrote about a little issue where I had to quickly get my lab hosts and vCenter upgraded to vSphere 7.0U3k luckily vSphere Lifecycle Manager saved me. During that process I discovered in vCenter there are a bunch of API calls you can make directly from the CLI once you SSH into vCenter.
When you SSH into vCenter you are prompted with serveral help commands:
List APIs: &amp;ldquo;help api list&amp;rdquo; List Plugins: &amp;ldquo;help pi list&amp;rdquo; Launch BASH: &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; Generally, I breeze right by this and type &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; and move on to the task at hand.</description>

      <description>Recently, I ran into an issue where I really needed to get my vSphere homelab upgraded to version 7.0U3k. More on why this was so urgent in a future post. However, I was still back on 7.0U3d. To get to 7.0U3 I used vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM). In case you missed it, vSphere Lifecycle Manager is built into vSphere 7.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with vLCM, then you can read more about vSphere Lifecycle Manager over here: https://blogs.</description>

      <description>Around this time last year I wrote about how to deploy a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. That post covered KeyControl version 5.2.1. You can find that blog post over here.
This post is very similar. The difference between it and the last post is that I will cover Entrust KeyControl version 5.4.. Are you scratching your head about the name change? Head over to this post I wrote about changes that occurred in January of this year where I talk about HyTrust being acquired by Entrust.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my How to Deploy a HyTrust KeyControl 2-node Cluster post I walked through the steps for deploying and configuring a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. Now that you have it deployed, let&amp;rsquo;s start using it. But before we can do that, we need to add it vCenter as a Key Provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s go!!
Before Starting Before starting, I want to clear up some terminology. If you are familiar with using encryption in vCenter 6.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will write about using the file-based backup feature in vCenter v7.0. Surprisingly, this feature has been available since vCenter 6.5. But, until recently, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard much about it.
Before getting started, you should read through the list of considerations and limitations of using file-based backups for vCenter. You can find the entire list on VMware&amp;rsquo;s documentation site.
This feature supports the following protocols:</description>

      <description>This week I am attending my very first VMworld Europe in, of all places, beautiful, Barcelona, Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ll write a synopsis of VMworld after it&amp;rsquo;s over, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to my blogging series after VMworld is over. For this post, I want to cover my first very International VMUG event. Continue reading for my viewpoint of the event.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out about the VMUG until the very last minute.</description>
