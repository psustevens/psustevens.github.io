      <description>Around this time last year I wrote about how to deploy a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. That post covered KeyControl version 5.2.1. You can find that blog post over here.
This post is very similar. The difference between it and the last post is that I will cover Entrust KeyControl version 5.4.. Are you scratching your head about the name change? Head over to this post I wrote about changes that occurred in January of this year where I talk about HyTrust being acquired by Entrust.</description>
