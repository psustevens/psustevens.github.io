      <description>I recently wrote about a little issue where I had to quickly get my lab hosts and vCenter upgraded to vSphere 7.0U3k luckily vSphere Lifecycle Manager saved me. During that process I discovered in vCenter there are a bunch of API calls you can make directly from the CLI once you SSH into vCenter.
When you SSH into vCenter you are prompted with serveral help commands:
List APIs: &amp;ldquo;help api list&amp;rdquo; List Plugins: &amp;ldquo;help pi list&amp;rdquo; Launch BASH: &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; Generally, I breeze right by this and type &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; and move on to the task at hand.</description>
