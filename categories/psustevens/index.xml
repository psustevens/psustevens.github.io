      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-bit-about-me&#34;&gt;A bit about me&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire.  My wife and I have lived in New England for many years.  We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.   I supported the EqualLogic and Compellent SAN products and their NAS front-end for both of those systems by the name of Fluid File System.  After a few years, I moved to a startup by the  name of DataGravity where I was also a technical marketing engineer.  After a few years at DataGravity, HyTrust came along and scooped us up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
