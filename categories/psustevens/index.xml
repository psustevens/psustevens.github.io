      <description>Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.
A bit about me I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire. My wife and I have lived in New England for many years. We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.</description>
