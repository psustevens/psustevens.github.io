      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for a new job. But due to an unforeseen curveball, I now work for Pure Storage. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a planned move, but looking back (6 months now). I have no complaints!! I wish all of my friends and colleagues at Entrust the best of luck and I know we will see each other at future trade shows or somewhere else along our travels.</description>

      <description>Most people post their New Years&amp;rsquo; blog posts within the first week of the new year. But, there have been some things brewing that I needed to wait to complete. This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t like my other posts. It&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at what transpired in 2020 and what I hope to accomplish this year.</description>

      <description>This post is one of those times where I put tech aside. So, if you are only interested in tech-related blog posts, then you may want to skip this one.
