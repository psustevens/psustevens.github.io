      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for a new job. But due to an unforeseen curveball, I now work for Pure Storage. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a planned move, but looking back (6 months now). I have no complaints!! I wish all of my friends and colleagues at Entrust the best of luck and I know we will see each other at future trade shows or somewhere else along our travels.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about a little issue where I had to quickly get my lab hosts and vCenter upgraded to vSphere 7.0U3k luckily vSphere Lifecycle Manager saved me. During that process I discovered in vCenter there are a bunch of API calls you can make directly from the CLI once you SSH into vCenter.</description>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s no mystery that I run a homelab for personal and work purposes. I&amp;rsquo;m also lucky to own two Synology NAS arrays. My first NAS unit is a DS414. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit old, but it continues to hum along nicely. I need to make some time to upgrade the firmware on it.</description>

      <description>Recently, I ran into an issue where I really needed to get my vSphere homelab upgraded to version 7.0U3k. More on why this was so urgent in a future post. However, I was still back on 7.0U3d. To get to 7.0U3 I used vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM). In case you missed it, vSphere Lifecycle Manager is built into vSphere 7.</description>

      <description>Around this time last year I wrote about how to deploy a 2-node HyTrust KeyControl cluster. That post covered KeyControl version 5.2.1. You can find that blog post over here.
This post is very similar. The difference between it and the last post is that I will cover Entrust KeyControl version 5.</description>

      <description>Most people post their New Years&amp;rsquo; blog posts within the first week of the new year. But, there have been some things brewing that I needed to wait to complete. This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t like my other posts. It&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at what transpired in 2020 and what I hope to accomplish this year.</description>

      <description>I hit my first anniversary of blogging this past September. As you may have noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit lax over the main course of this year. I know, I know. With the whole COVID thing going on this year, you would have thought there would have been more time to blog.</description>
