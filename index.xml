      <description>In the previous post, I covered how to build your first Hugo site using the Hugo Future Imperfect Slim theme. I also walked through the process to create the first blog post for your new site. In this post, I&#39;m going to walk through different customization options for the theme. The customizations aren&#39;t exhaustive but are good enough for you to get started and possibly expand on. Let&#39;s get started.</description>

In this blog series, I&#39;m going to talk about how I built my blog site using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first post of my technical blog where I will write about virtualization technologies such as VMware and Microsoft, desktop and server technologies from Microsoft and the occasional script based on PowerShell.
 A bit about me I hail from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in New Hampshire. My wife and I have lived in New England for many years. We moved up here so I could work for Dell as a technical marketing engineer in their storage group.</description>
